ABSTRACT

This paper presents a project for an automatic door lock system that integrates face recognition with Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology to enhance security in smart environments. With the increasing need for robust access control in both residential and commercial settings, this work aims to develop a system that accurately authenticates users through biometric facial data, thereby eliminating the dependence on traditional keys or passcodes. The research was carried out in several phases: data acquisition, system architecture development, model training, and real-world evaluation. Initially, a diverse dataset comprising facial images captured under varying lighting conditions and angles was compiled to ensure robustness. Preprocessing steps, including face detection, normalization, and data augmentation, were employed to optimize image quality for recognition purposes. The methodology utilized state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms integrated with IoT communication protocols to enable real-time control of the door lock mechanism. Experimental results indicate that the system achieves a recognition accuracy exceeding 75% with a minimal false acceptance rate, demonstrating its effectiveness in authenticating authorized individuals promptly. The implications of this research extend to enhancing security infrastructures while contributing to the broader adoption of smart home technologies. Challenges remain in addressing privacy concerns, varying environmental conditions, and ensuring low-latency performance, which necessitate continuous system updates and optimizations.

1.1 Introduction

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

In this new era of technology, people continuously seek innovative ways to simplify our lives while ensuring the security of our investments. Modern security systems now strive for self-surveillance, eliminating the need for constant human monitoring, and digital locks are proving more effective than traditional ones in protecting our spaces.

To address these challenges, the Automatic Door Lock System using Face Recognition and IoT offers a modern solution by integrating biometric authentication with IoT technology. This system utilizes facial recognition algorithms that employ Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for identifying authorized individuals and the Euclidean distance method for classification, ensuring efficient and accurate operation. When a person's face matches the stored data, the door unlocks; if not, the system alerts the owner via SMS or email. Additionally, IoT integration enables real-time monitoring and remote access through smartphones, thereby enhancing security and convenience.
The objective of facial recognition in this context is to analyze a series of face data from a set of training images stored in a database. When a captured image corresponds to one of these stored images, the door is unlocked; if not, it remains locked

1.2 Background Study
The Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a revolutionary technology that enables the connection of various devices and objects to the Internet. This connectivity allows them to communicate, exchange data, and perform intelligent actions. Within the realm of home automation and security, IoT presents significant opportunities for the development of smart and secure systems. In the context of home automation and security, IoT offers tremendous potential for creating smart and secure systems. Traditional door lock systems often rely on physical keys, which can be lost or stolen, and lack advanced features like remote access and user identification.
These limitations pose security risks and inconvenience for homeowners. Therefore, there is a need to develop an IoT-based smart door lock system that integrates advanced technologies to overcome these challenges and provide a higher level of security and convenience (Patel & Verma, 2017; Yedulapuram et al., 2020; Esan et al., 2023).




The IoT has gained significant attention and adoption in recent years due to its potential to revolutionize various industries and domains (Castro et al., 2017; Ni et al., 2015). In the context of home automation, the IoT offers tremendous opportunities for creating smart home systems that enhance convenience, comfort, and security for homeowners (Verma, 2023). A smart home system leverages IoT technologies to connect and control various devices within a home, such as lighting systems, thermostats, security cameras, door locks, and appliances (Ni et al., 2015). These devices are equipped with sensors and connected to a central hub or gateway, allowing homeowners to remotely monitor and manage them through a smartphone or other internet-connected devices. The benefits of a smart home system are manifold. It offers homeowners the ability to automate routine tasks, such as adjusting lighting and temperature settings, scheduling appliance usage, and monitoring energy consumption (Ni et al., 2015). Additionally, smart home systems provide enhanced security features, such as remote surveillance and access control, allowing homeowners to monitor their homes and receive real-time alerts in case of any unusual activities (Dhobale et al., 2020).

Moreover, smart home systems contribute to energy efficiency and sustainability by optimizing resource consumption and reducing waste (Ni et al., 2015). By intelligently managing energy usage and providing insights into energy patterns, homeowners can make informed decisions to conserve energy and lower their utility bills (Ni et al., 2015; Vijayakumar et al., 2019). The proliferation of IoT devices and the availability of robust communication protocols and cloud-based platforms have made smart home systems more accessible and affordable for homeowners (Verma, 2023).

With advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning, smart home systems can learn and adapt to user preferences, creating personalized and intuitive experiences (Shahzad et al., 2024; Zhang et al., 2024). As the demand for connected and intelligent homes continues to grow, the integration of IoT technologies in the home environment holds immense potential (Ni et al., 2015). It not only enhances the quality of life for homeowners but also opens up new possibilities for energy management, healthcare monitoring, and assisted living for the elderly and individuals with disabilities (Ni et al., 2015; Patel & Verma, 2017). In this report, we delve into the design and implementation of a smart home system that leverages IoT technologies. We explore the integration of devices, the



utilization of data analytics and machine learning algorithms, and the interaction with users through intuitive interfaces (Verma, 2023). Through this project, we aim to showcase the capabilities of IoT in transforming traditional homes into intelligent, connected spaces that offer enhanced comfort, convenience, and security for homeowners (Yedulapuram et al., 2020).

Global urbanization coupled with growing security concerns has compelled nations to explore advanced methods for safeguarding homes, offices, and critical infrastructures (Patel & Verma, 2017; Esan et al., 2023). Traditional door locking mechanisms-relying on physical keys, numeric codes, or keycards-are vulnerable to theft, duplication, or hacking (Datta et al., 2015; Labeodan et al., 2015). As a result, biometric technologies such as face recognition have emerged as a reliable alternative that not only enhances security but also improves user-friendliness (Yatmono et al., 2022; Patel & Verma, 2017).

With the expansion of the Internet of Things (IoT), integrating biometric technology with IoT-enabled devices has revolutionized security systems worldwide (Yedulapuram et al., 2020; P. R. et al., 2025). The current project reflects a global trend toward combining artificial intelligence (AI) with IoT to develop intelligent, efficient, and secure access systems (Patel & Verma, 2017; Yatmono et al., 2022). Different countries have adopted these technologies in various ways:


United States: The rapid growth of smart home devices and automation has led to the widespread adoption of integrated security systems (Verma, 2023). In the U.S., smart locks, surveillance cameras, and alarm systems are increasingly common in residential areas (Dhobale et al., 2020). Privacy regulations, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), underscore the importance of secure data management in these systems (California Consumer Privacy Act, 2018).

China: As a global leader in face recognition technology, China has extensively implemented biometric systems in public surveillance and smart cities (Wang et al., 2019). The integration of AI and IoT is key in enhancing urban security, allowing citizens to access secure areas through biometric authentication (Yatmono et al., 2022).
Somalia: In nations facing political instability and security challenges, traditional security



measures often fall short (Ahmed & Mohamud, 2025). With growing urbanization and digital connectivity, IoT-based solutions, like the proposed automatic door lock system, are seen as vital in improving security for homes, businesses, and public spaces (Patel & Verma, 2017). This project aligns with Somalia's gradual modernization and its push for advanced security technologies (Yedulapuram et al., 2020).

1.3 Problem Statement
In Somali smart houses and commercial buildings, current security frameworks face several critical issues that impede efficient and reliable protection. One significant problem is the lack of centralized data management and real-time monitoring. Security devices such as cameras, motion detectors, and alarms operate in isolation rather than as parts of an integrated network. This fragmentation results in delayed detection of security breaches and hinders the ability to respond promptly to potential threats.

Another issue is the limited system integration and interoperability among diverse security components. In many installations, various devices from different manufacturers cannot communicate effectively with each other. This disconnect prevents the seamless aggregation and analysis of data, which is crucial for developing a comprehensive situational awareness system. Without a unified platform, it becomes challenging to coordinate alerts and actions, thereby reducing overall system reliability.

Additionally, the absence of advanced biometric authentication methods, such as face recognition, further compromises security. Traditional access controls, often reliant on static identifiers, are less effective in dynamically verifying user identities. Without the ability to accurately and rapidly authenticate individuals through facial recognition, unauthorized access remains a persistent risk. This shortfall undermines user confidence and leaves the system vulnerable to breaches, especially in environments where remote monitoring and automated responses are critical.

leading to issues such as latency in data transmission and unreliable remote connectivity. These technical challenges exacerbate the risk of delayed responses during security incidents and complicate the implementation of robust IoT-based security measures.
Collectively, these issues underscore the urgent need for a cohesive, automated solution that



leverages IoT and face recognition technology to address the shortcomings of current security systems in Somali smart houses and commercial buildings. Such a solution would aim to ensure real-time data integration, improve system responsiveness, and enhance the accuracy of user identification, thereby delivering a higher standard of security and operational efficiency.

The project is designed to overcome the challenges and limitations of conventional home security systems and access control mechanisms. Traditional systems often lack the following features Limited Remote Access: Existing systems typically require physical presence or proximity to operate, restricting users from monitoring and controlling their security systems remotely.
Lack of Smart Integration: Many traditional access control mechanisms operate as isolated units and do not integrate with other smart devices, hindering the development of a comprehensive home automation ecosystem.

Inadequate User Interaction: The reliance on physical keypads or manual entry methods reduces user convenience and overall system usability.
Limited User Identification: Conventional methods based on keys or passcodes are susceptible to unauthorized access. There is a clear need for a more robust user identification and authentication approach.
By addressing these issues, the project aims to develop a sophisticated smart home security system that leverages IoT, cloud computing, and modern biometric techniques.

CHAPTER 2
LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1 Introduction
This chapter explores the literature surrounding the key technologies that constitute the Automatic Door Lock System by Face Recognition in the context of IoT. The literature review examines the evolution of these technologies, their current applications, and the various challenges and future directions in developing and deploying such systems. Key aspects such as the technical architecture, security concerns, system performance, and potential use cases in different domains will also be discussed.

2.2 Overview of the Project
The project focuses on developing an Automatic Door Lock System using Face Recognition and the Internet of Things (IoT) to enhance security and user convenience. This system aims to integrate modern biometric authentication with IoT technology to provide a secure, efficient, and automated solution for access control.

The IoT component adds an extra layer of convenience by enabling users to control and monitor the lock remotely, as well as receive real-time notifications. The system aims to offer both high security and ease of use, eliminating the need for traditional keys or passwords.

The successful implementation of this project will result in a smart, secure, and efficient access control system that eliminates the traditional need for physical keys, passwords, or keycards. The face recognition feature adds an additional layer of security, reducing the risk of unauthorized access due to lost or stolen credentials.



2.3 Related Work
Several studies have explored the integration of biometric technologies and Internet of Things (IoT) to enhance access control and security systems, particularly in residential and commercial environments. This growing body of research highlights innovations in face recognition algorithms, sensor-based automation, and remote monitoring via IoT platforms. For instance, Huang et al. (2018) developed a real-time face recognition system using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), improving the system's reliability under varying lighting conditions and facial orientations. Their study provided strong evidence that deep learning techniques significantly enhance the accuracy of facial recognition for security applications.
Similarly, a system proposed by Wang et al. (2019) demonstrated the use of IoT-based facial authentication for smart door locks, allowing users to receive real-time access notifications and manage lock status remotely via cloud platforms. Their implementation combined Raspberry Pi, camera modules, and cloud-hosted databases, highlighting the potential of combining edge computing and cloud analytics in access control systems.

2.1.1 Face Recognition-Based Access Control Systems
Face recognition technology has become a popular method of access control due to its accuracy, ease of use, and non-intrusive nature. Researchers have focused on enhancing the precision of face recognition algorithms, especially in varying conditions like different lighting or facial angles. For instance, Huang et al. (2018) worked on a real-time face recognition system using deep learning-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which improved recognition accuracy even in challenging environments. Their work paved the way for face recognition to be adopted in automated door locks and other security applications.

In another study, Geng et al. (2020) integrated face recognition with motion sensors in a smart home system. Their design enabled automatic door unlocking when an authorized individual approached, demonstrating the ability to combine biometric authentication with additional sensor technologies. This research is particularly relevant as it showcases the benefits of combining face recognition with other features for a smoother user experience. One of the ongoing challenges with face recognition, however, is ensuring reliability under various environmental conditions, such as low lighting or when individuals have changed their appearance (e.g., wearing glasses, changing hairstyles). Some researchers have been



exploring hybrid approaches that combine face recognition with other authentication methods, like voice recognition or fingerprint scanning, to address these limitations.

2.1.2 IoT-Enabled Smart Lock Systems
The use of IoT technology in smart locks has been an area of active research and development. Vijayakumar et al. (2019) examined the use of IoT in smart home security, allowing users to unlock doors remotely via a smartphone app. Their system relied on cloud connectivity to facilitate communication between the door lock and user devices, making it convenient for users to control their security systems from anywhere in the world.

Further, Lee et al. (2020) proposed an IoT-based smart lock that included features like remote unlocking, real-time access logs, and emergency access protocols. This work highlighted the flexibility of IoT-enabled locks, offering users a higher level of control and adaptability compared to traditional mechanical locks. Additionally, their research focused on ensuring secure communication and minimizing vulnerabilities in the IoT infrastructure, which is crucial for preventing unauthorized access.

These IoT-based locks can also integrate with other smart home devices, such as security cameras, lighting systems, and alarms, to create a unified security ecosystem. The growing adoption of smart home platforms like Amazon Alexa and Google Home has further contributed to the widespread use of IoT-enabled locks in residential and commercial settings. However, challenges remain in terms of connectivity issues and the security of IoT communication, especially in areas with unreliable internet connections.

2.4 Integration of Face Recognition and IoT
The combination of face recognition and IoT has emerged as a powerful tool for creating smarter, more secure access control systems. Wang et al. (2019) proposed an integrated system that combines both face recognition and IoT connectivity to remotely manage door locks. Their solution allowed users to control the door remotely and receive notifications whenever an access attempt occurred. The system also included a mobile app for seamless interaction, which allowed users to monitor the security status of their home or office at all times.Similarly, Choudhary et al. (2021) explored the integration of face recognition and IoT in a smart building environment. Their approach personalized access to different rooms



based on the user's identity, combining face recognition with IoT-enabled devices to adjust settings like lighting and HVAC. This integration provided an additional layer of security while improving the overall user experience by automating environmental adjustments based on the person accessing the space.

This fusion of technologies is attractive because it offers the benefits of both systems-face recognition for secure, biometric-based authentication, and IoT for remote control, monitoring, and flexibility. However, achieving seamless integration between these two technologies requires overcoming several technical hurdles, including optimizing the performance of face recognition algorithms within IoT infrastructures, ensuring real-time processing, and securing communication channels to prevent cyber threats.

2.5 Sensors Used in Existing Projects
In many projects exploring automatic door lock systems with face recognition and IoT connectivity, a variety of sensors have been employed to ensure the system works reliably and securely. One of the most common components is the camera module. These systems often use high-resolution cameras capable of capturing detailed facial images even in less- than-ideal lighting conditions. Some camera modules also include infrared (IR) capabilities, which means they can effectively capture clear images at night or in dark areas, ensuring the system's functionality 24/7.
Another sensor frequently seen in these projects is the motion detection sensor. For example, passive infrared (PIR) sensors are widely used because they can detect the heat emitted by a human body. This helps the system activate the camera only when someone is nearby, reducing unnecessary operation and conserving energy. In some designs, ultrasonic sensors are also integrated to measure the distance between the door and the person approaching.
This additional layer of detection not only confirms presence but also helps to minimize false activations.



Beyond these, standalone infrared sensors are sometimes incorporated separately from the camera. Their role is to bolster detection accuracy in situations where ambient light is low or inconsistent. The combination of various sensor types cameras, PIR sensors, ultrasonic sensors, and standalone IR sensors allows for what is commonly known as sensor fusion. By merging data from these multiple sources, the system is better able to accurately verify a person's presence and make informed decisions about access control.

Lastly, the integration of these sensors within an IoT framework is crucial. Real-time sensor data is often transmitted to a centralized processing unit or cloud-based system, enabling remote monitoring and control. This connectivity not only supports the use of sophisticated face recognition algorithms but also allows system administrators to receive alerts and manage access remotely. As a result, the overall performance and security of the door lock system are significantly enhanced.

Overall, the smart combination of various sensor technologies is what gives these automatic door lock systems their reliability. By using cameras alongside motion and infrared sensors, and tying everything together through IoT, existing projects have created systems that can operate efficiently under a range of conditions while providing a high level of security.
2.6 Previous Work and Existing Projects
Over the past few years, researchers and engineers have explored various approaches to designing automatic door lock systems that leverage face recognition and IoT technologies. Early projects focused on combining cost-effective hardware with basic facial recognition algorithms to create functional prototypes. Many of these initial systems employed widely available microcontrollers like Arduino or single-board computers such as the Raspberry Pi, paired with standard camera modules. These setups provided a proof-of-concept for automated access control, demonstrating that face recognition could serve as a viable means of verifying identity under controlled conditions.
Building on these early designs, subsequent projects introduced more advanced elements to enhance both security and functionality. For example, several implementations integrated additional sensors, such as passive infrared (PIR) and ultrasonic sensors, to detect the presence of individuals and reduce the likelihood of false triggers. These sensors worked in tandem with the camera module, ensuring that the system only attempted face recognition when a person was actually present at the door. This sensor fusion not only improved the



system's responsiveness but also optimized energy usage by minimizing unnecessary processing. More recent work has seen the adoption of sophisticated face recognition algorithms, often based on deep learning techniques, to increase accuracy even in challenging environments with variable lighting conditions. These projects take advantage of IoT connectivity to send real-time data to cloud-based services, where advanced processing and storage capabilities can further enhance decision-making.
The ability to update algorithms remotely and monitor system performance in real time has led to significant improvements in both reliability and security. Some projects have also addressed concerns related to spoofing or unauthorized access by implementing additional security measures such as liveness detection and multi- factor authentication.

RESEARCH METHODOLOGY


3.1 Introduction
This chapter outlines the methodology used in the development of the Smart Automatic Door Lock System by Face Recognition using IoT. The goal of this project is to create a modern, secure, and contactless access control solution, utilizing computer vision, microcontroller automation, and cloud-based control. By integrating these technologies, the system enables seamless, real-time facial recognition that automatically grants or denies access to users based on their facial features. This system is designed to replace traditional key-based of access the methods, offering a higher level of the security, convenience, and ease of use .
The system employs Raspberry Pi as the central processing unit, using a USB camera or Pi camera for capturing the facial images, which are then processed through a facial recognition algorithm. Once a match is found in the database, an electromagnetic or solenoid lock is triggered to either unlock or remain secured, depending on the result of the recognition process. Additionally, the system includes features for remote monitoring and management via cloud integration, allowing users to check the status of the lock and provide access from anywhere. This chapter describes the comprehensive project design, highlighting the integration of hardware components, the implementation of software tools for facial recognition, and how these elements work together to deliver a fully functional IoT-based door lock system. Additionally, it provides an overview of the data collection and analysis methods, the budgeting for the project, and a feasibility study that demonstrates the viability and scalability of the system.



3.2 Project Design
The design of the Smart Automatic Door Lock System by Face Recognition using IoT combines both hardware and software components to deliver a comprehensive and secure access control solution. This system replaces traditional key-based access methods with facial authentication, enhancing security and eliminating the risks associated with lost keys or stolen access cards.

The hardware design incorporates several key components, each playing an essential role in the operation of the system:

The Raspberry Pi serves as the central processing unit (CPU) for the entire system. It handles facial recognition tasks, processes input data from the camera, and controls other components like the relay and lock mechanism.

The USB webcam or Pi camera module captures real-time facial images, which are then processed by the Raspberry Pi to detect and compare facial features against the stored database of authorized faces.

The relay module acts as the intermediary between the Raspberry Pi and the electromagnetic/solenoid lock, controlling the door's locking mechanism based on the outcome of the facial recognition process.

The buzzer provides immediate feedback by emitting an audible signal when access is either granted or denied.

On the software side, the system utilizes the OpenCV library, a powerful tool for computer vision and image processing, which is responsible for detecting faces, recognizing them, and verifying the identity of the individual. The Python programming language is used to implement the facial recognition algorithm and manage all system functions, including communication between hardware components via GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi.

The system's cloud-based integration enables remote control and monitoring, providing users with real-time updates and the ability to grant or deny access from a distance. This cloud functionality also allows for event logging and system status updates, which can be accessed via a mobile app or web interface. These features not only enhance the system's



usability but also contribute to its scalability, allowing for future expansions, such as integrating multiple locks or additional forms of authentication.

The modular design of the system allows for easy customization and expansion. Future updates could include the integration of additional security features such as multi-factor authentication, support for different types of access control (e.g., PIN codes or RFID), and enhanced cloud services for better management and data analytics

Such integration ensures adaptability, scalability, and higher levels of protection. It also builds public trust by minimizing manual operations and increasing automation.
While the system worked well in most conditions, it faced challenges in poor lighting and with partial occlusions like sunglasses or masks. The lack of cloud-based backup or mobile notifications limits remote monitoring capabilities. Additionally, scalability to multiple doors or enterprise-level environments would require further enhancements in both software and hardware.
Although the Automatic Door Lock System by Face Recognition IoT was successfully implemented and met its primary objectives, several limitations were identified during its development, testing, and evaluation:















The system uses the Flutter IoT platform for mobile interaction and remote monitoring. This functionality is entirely dependent on a stable Wi-Fi connection. If the internet connection is



lost, the Flutter app becomes non-functional, disabling remote control and status tracking. This could be critical in environments where internet reliability is low.

Currently, the entire system is powered directly through an external power source. In the event of a power outage, the Raspberry Pi, camera module, and servo motor all stop functioning. This results in total system failure until power is restored, making the system unsuitable for locations with unstable electricity unless a backup battery or UPS is integrated.

The system stores recognized faces in a static dataset that must be updated manually through code and retraining. Adding new users or revoking access for a former users requires technical intervention. This lack of a dynamic, user-friendly interface limits scalability and administrative flexibility.
The facial recognition algorithm works well under good lighting conditions but struggles in low-light or backlit environments. This affects the accuracy and reliability of the system particularly during nighttime or in poorly lit entrances. Incorporating infrared or night-vision cameras would help address this limitation.



5.4 Future Enhancement
The system has proven reliable by combining IoT and facial recognition, making it secure, automated, and user-friendly. This integration reduces manual work, increases safety, and builds trust in modern access control.

In the future, the system can be improved by using deep learning models like FaceNet or Dlib for better accuracy. Mobile app integration can allow users to manage access remotely. Adding a battery backup, encrypting face data, and storing access logs in the cloud will make the system even more secure, flexible, and ready for real-world use to make the system more useful and advanced in the future, the following improvements can be added.
A rechargeable battery or UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply) can be included to keep the system running during power outages. This ensures that the face recognition, lock mechanism, and touchscreen interface continue to function without interruption.

Improve Internet Flexibility
The system can be enhanced to work even when the internet is down. Features like offline face recognition, local app control via Bluetooth, or SMS-based alerts can be added. This will allow users to unlock the door or get status updates even without Wi-Fi.
Although the system already includes a touchscreen display, future updates can add more functions such as on-screen user registration, live camera preview, manual override options, and system logs. This would improve ease of use, especially for non-technical users.
A Flutter-based mobile app can be expanded to let the admin view access logs, remotely approve or block users, and receive real-time door activity notifications. This gives full control even when away from home.

Add Encrypted Access Logs and Cloud Backup
Access history can be stored both locally on the device and in the cloud. Each entry can include the recognized face, time, and result (granted or denied). Data should be encrypted to protect privacy and can be used for reviewing security events.
